This module is somewhat inspired by [bocker](https://github.com/p8952/bocker)
and is based on code from [NodeOS](https://github.com/NodeOS/NodeOS), but
currently only provides mount of filesystems of a NodeOS by-user root hierarchy
and execution on an un-priviledged `chroot`ed environment, without any extra
`LXC` cool feature.
